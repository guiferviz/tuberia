# Contributing to Tuberia

## Getting started

You need:

* Spark 3.2.
* Java JDK 11 (Required by Spark).
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
* Make.

Once you have all the tools installed just open a shell on the root folder of
the project and install the dependencies in a new virtual environment with:

```sh
$ make install
```

The previous command also installs some [pre-commits](https://pre-commit.com).

Check that your package is installed with:

```sh
$ poetry run tuberia

Version 0.0.0
```

If you can see that funky logo your installation is correct. Note that the
version may change.

If you do not want to use `poetry run` in front of all your commands just
activate the virtual environment with `poetry shell`. Use `exit` if you want to
deactivate the environment.


## How do I build the package?

You can build the package without installing the dependencies or without a
proper Spark installation. Use `make build` or just `make`. You should see
something like:

```sh
$ make
poetry build
Building tuberia (0.0.0)

## How do I run tests?

## Contribution guidelines

* The code is auto-formatted by Black, so you can write the code without
following any style guide and a Black pre-commit will take care of making it
consistent with the current codebase.
* Write tests: test not added in the PR, test that will never be added.
